If the timer on the map has ran out the traitors loose x number of points 50? (it's a pretty bad thing to let happen)

Killing someone with a higher rank = more points, lesser rank = less points (make it more even a playing field) 

Traitor dies without a single kill -20 points? or more because that's pretty pathetic :P
