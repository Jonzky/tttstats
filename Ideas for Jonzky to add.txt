Number of rounds won as either Traitor or innocent? So on round end grab all the alive innocents and all the alive traitors and increase this value by 1? or just all the innocents and all the traitors but i think keeping it to alive would limit potential lag and that's when you technically won and not died and allowed others to win for you...
