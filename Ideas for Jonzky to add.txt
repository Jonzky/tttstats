Number of rounds won as either Traitor or innocent? So on round end grab all the alive innocents and all the alive traitors and increase this value by 1? or just all the innocents and all the traitors but i think keeping it to alive would limit potential lag and that's when you technically won and not died and allowed others to win for you...

Points system!

lets get our ideas of a points system that will be custom to the server and not just using the inbuilt score system, all of these things should be controlled by variables and be subject to easy change.


Action	Points
Innocent KILL Traitor	+5
Innocent KILL Innocent	-10
Innocent Kill Detective -20

 
Traitor KILL Innocent	+5
Traior KILL Detective +10?
Traitor KILL Traitor	-20


Detective KILL Traitor	+5
Detective KILL Innocent	-5
Detective KILL Detective -20


Surviving the Round +2
Dying	-1 (during active round phase)

So assuming that you play a game and die in a game dealing 0 damage to anyone your default is -1
good things = +5 - 10 
bad things =-5 - 20
This allows for basically easy backtracking/ minus points where posotive points are harder to come by/ keep ahold of.

Changes to rank system? 

So it's starting to look like that Rank is going to tend to be those who spend the most amount of time on the server.

Perhaps we can write an algorhythm that takes multiple stats into account? such as KDR (positive KDR + some rank, negative - some rank) 

Or other methods, it could become quite complex. However writing that might be harder in LUA and it might cause strain on the server to compute that between everyone...

Perhaps another method?? who knows.


**New things to track**

Wins (innocents win all innocent get + 1 win, visa versa)
loss (traitors loose, all traitors get +1 loss
Win/ loss ration (wins / loss) can be done via SQL command.
