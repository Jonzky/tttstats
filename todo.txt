==HTML/ PHP coding===

discuss idea of multiple tables - one per server, rather then 1 big one

create a tool that allows a user to search their steamid and if they're able to apply for admin (based on bans, timeplayed & first seen comparrison?)

Split up all top10 into different pages, perhaps top10 per thing?? change to top 30? add different options?? idk.
