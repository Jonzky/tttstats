discuss idea of multiple tables - one per server, rather then 1 big one

check SB database for bans on a user that's searched? and link back to their bans?

create a tool that allows a user to search their steamid and if they're able to apply for admin (based on bans, timeplayed & first seen comparrison?)

Highscores! (top10 playtime, kills, deaths, score, etc.)

look into the idea of a loading page that grabs steamid from the gmod client and then uses that in the SQL query (personal loading url)
