==HTML/ PHP coding===

discuss idea of multiple tables - one per server, rather then 1 big one

create a tool that allows a user to search their steamid and if they're able to apply for admin (based on bans, timeplayed & first seen comparrison?)

Interface with the SteamAPI so that when we have details of a single user from search we can get their other steam stats such as avatar etc. (I'm not strong on my JSON yet, will take a little while to test etc)

Finish up e-mail validation(the e-mailing the val code as well as if their active = 0 tell them they're not active and don't allow a login)

Play with the idea of using RCON in TTT stats for certain things... not sure what i would really do for the moment :/ but hey it might be fun.
