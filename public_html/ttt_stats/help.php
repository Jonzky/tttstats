	<h3>Installation Help!</h3>
	
	<h5>The web stuff!</h5>
	
	<p>Installation of the webstuff is very easy and straight forward, first of all you need to create a new user and database and give this user access to the newly created database. This user needs to have the normal permissions as well as create tables (because the creation of the SQL tables is automated/ achieved during setup).</p>
	
	<p>Once you have created the database user, remember that information! we'll need it later! next we simply goto yourwebsite/ttt_stats/install/index.php from there all you have to do is follow the instructions/ forms and everything should be taken care of.</p>
	
	<h5>The Game server stuffs!</h5>

	<p>Jonzky! You should come over here! and write stuff!</p>
