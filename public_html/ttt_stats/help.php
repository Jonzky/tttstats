	<h5>The web stuff!</h5>
	
	<p><b>1.</b> Upload the folder "ttt_stats" from the web_upload folder to you webserver, keeping attention that i'm bad and for now it should stay in a folder called "ttt_stats".</p>
	<p><b>2.</b> Create a new database user, give it the normal permissions as well as "create" giving it access to the new database you've setup.</p>
	<p><b>3.</b> goto www.yourwebsitehere/ttt_stats/install/ and follow the forms, paying attention to the fact that you will need your database information.</p>	
	<p><b>4.</b> Once installation has been complete check that you're able to log in with the account you created during installation (Check your e-mail for a verification from the installation.)</p>	
	<p><b>5.</b> Once you've confirmed your ability to log into the control panel, delete the /install directory from your webserver.</p>	
	<p><b>6.</b> If your game server is correctly connecting to this database and saving information you should start to see pages fill up with information.</p>
