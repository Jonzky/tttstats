							<p>Welcome to Handy_man's and Jonzky's Trouble in Terrorist Town Stat tracking website! This website is in Beta, feel free to check everything out and report any problems.</p>
							<p>Here is an example of my latest attempt at a "badge" <img src="http://www.thehiddennation.com/ttt_stats/badge.php?i=STEAM_0:1:24438298&t=all"></img></p>
							<p>The idea of the badge system allows users to dynamically generate a smallish image with all of their TTT stats from the SNGaming.org's servers</p>
							</br>
							<p>This has now been released! goto : <a href="http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1277865">Facepunch</a> to find out more!
