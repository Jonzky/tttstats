I should probably have the following pages in my install:

License agreement (i have no responsibility over the fact that you might break something, creative commons license etc)

Database information/ setup (hostname, port, username, password, databasename.) (maybe table prefix? might be better for helping against SQLI)
After database information is given preform a write to the config files and test the connection? if it's failed don't let them continue
serverhostname and server port should be automatically set to localhost and 3306 respectively.

Table creation (just a page that creats all the database specific things i need)

Setup (admin username, adminpassword, confirm password, e-mail.) (insert this into our database as the superuser, perhaps make a system that means he can't be deleted)
